# Usage

## part2.py

Gets in the training data and create word dictionary and hashtag dictionary

Until now, I only considered making words in the lower case.

You can check `word` and `hashtag` after executing the code.

```
python -i part2.py tweets.train.head.dup.txt - -
python -i part2.py tweets.train.txt - -
python -i part2.py tweets.train.head.txt - -
```
